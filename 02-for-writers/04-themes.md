# Themes

TYPEMILL ships with the standard theme called "Typemill". Typemill is an univeral theme that you can use for documentations as well as for any other kind of text-work. You can configure the theme in the author panel under `settings` and `themes`. We will add a lot more themes for specific needs in the future.

 If there is a new version of the theme available, then you will see an update banner in the theme area of the author panel. To update a theme, open your FTP-software, go to the theme folder of your typemill installation, delete the old folder of your theme (e.g. `/themes/typemill`) and upload the new folder.

If you are a developer or web-designer, you can easily create your own theme with the template language Twig. Please read the [theme documentation](/theme-developers) for more details.
