# Publish Pages

For an author, it is crucial to have an intuitive overview about the state of the actual content and of all pages: Is the page online or offline? Is there a draft? Are there unpublished changes? 

With TYPEMILL you can:

* Save a draft.
* Publish a draft.
* Save a draft for a published page and publish the changes later.
* Unpublish a page, so that it becomes a draft again.
* Delete a page.

Everything is displayed in a handy edit-bar that sticks at the bottom of each page.

Additionally all drafts and unpublished changes are marked red in the navigation, so you can always check the status of all pages of your website.
