# Typemill

TYPEMILL is a simple and lightweight flat file cms. It has a clear focus on the author experience and provides a dashboard for distraction free editing and web-publishing. It is especially created for a non-technical audience and tries to keep web-publishing as simple as possible.

The **author dashboard** provides configurations for themes and plugins and an editor for content pages. Authors can choose between a raw markdown editor and a new visual markdown editor with an user-friendly WYSIWYG-mode. With the interactive navigation authors can create and organize their content-pages with drag & drop like on a file system.

**Developers** can use a flexible and easy system for themes and plugins to extend TYPEMILL.
