# Features

TYPEMILL is ready for use. It already runs several successful websites like [cmsstash.de](https://cmsstash.de), my own special interest website with more than 10% growth each month. But TYPEMILL is also a work in progress and new features are added every few weeks. This is what you can do with TYPEMILL right now:

- Create a website based on simple folders and markdown-files.
- Login and use the author panel.
- Add "admin" users or new "editors" with limited access.
- Write content with a raw markdown-editor.
- Write content with a visual markdown editor and with a direct preview of content blocks.
- Create new pages in the navigation.
- Reorder pages in the navigation with drag & drop.
- Upload images
- Choose themes and plugins with detailed settings.
- Create your own theme with HTML, CSS and Twig (a template language for PHP).
- Create your own plugins with PHP.

TYPEMILL scans the content in the content folder and generates a website on the fly. It creates SEO-friendly urls, it adds a full navigation, a breadcrumb, a paging, chapter-numbers, it generates a google sitemap out of the box and much more.
