# Features

TYPEMILL already provides a lot of useful features and we add new features every few weeks. This is what you can do with TYPEMILL right now:

- Super simple setup of a new website. 
- Add new users with full admin-rights or limited editor-rights.
- Create and edit your content online or simply use file-uploads for it (markdown-files/FTP).
- Create and re-order pages with drag & drop directly in the navigation-tree.
- Fully control the visibility of a page with draft, publish and depublish. 
- Revise a page while you keep the original version online (even WP does not have it in core!!).
- Use raw markdown or a fancy visual block-editor to edit content. 
- The visual block-editor provides image-uploads, markdown-tables and much more.
- Markdown supports extras like Table of Content (TOC) and even math.
- Choose and configure themes and plugins.
- Write your own themes with HTML, CSS and Twig.
- Write your own plugins with PHP.

TYPEMILL-websites are SEO-friendly with pretty urls and a google-sitemap out of the box, the website provides a full navigation, breadcrumbs, paging, chapter-numbers and much more. 

TYPEMILL already runs several successful websites like [cmsstash.de](https://cmsstash.de), my own special interest website with more than 10% growth each month. But TYPEMILL is also a work in progress so you might miss some features now that will be added in future.
