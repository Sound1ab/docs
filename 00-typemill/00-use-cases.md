# Use Cases

TYPEMILL is a small CMS dedicated to writers and their text-work. So if you want to publish a finished text as a website and if you like the markdown syntax to create your text, then TYPEMILL is a smart and lightweight solution. Use TYPEMILL for â€¦

- documentations
- manuals
- a lightweight wiki
- user guides
- whitepapers
- handbooks
- tutorials
- studies
- web-books
- lyric collections
- collections of articles

You can also create a portfolio-website or a classic website with TYPEMILL. But for now, TYPEMILL does not support time-based entries, so if you want to create a blog or a news-magazine, then you should look for another CMS.
