# Use Cases

Whenever you want to publish a finished text work as a website and if you like writing with markdown, then TYPEMILL is a smart and lightweight solution. Use TYPEMILL for â€¦

- documentations
- manuals
- a lightweight wiki
- user guides
- whitepapers
- handbook
- tutorial
- studies
- web-books
- lyric collections
- collections of articles

You can also create a portfolio-website or a classic website. But for now, TYPEMILL does not support time-based postings, so if you want to create a blog or a news-magazine, then you should look for another CMS.
