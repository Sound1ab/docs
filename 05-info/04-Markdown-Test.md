# Markdown Reference and Test Page

Markdown is a simple and universal syntax for text formatting. More and more writers switch to markdown, because they can format their text during the writing process without using any format-buttons. Once they are familiar with the markdown syntax, they can write formatted text much easier and faster than with any standard HTML-editor.

Developers love markdown, because it is much cleaner and saver than HTML. And they can easily convert markdown to a lot of other document formats like HTML and others.

If you develop a theme for TYPEMILL, please take care that all elements on this page are designed properly.

##Table of Contents

To create a table of contents, simply write `[TOC]` in a separate line. It will be replaced with a table of contents like this automatically.

[TOC]

## Headlines

```
Headlines are simply done with hash chars like this:
# First Level Headline
## Second Level Headline
### Third Level Headline
#### Fourth Level Headline
##### Fifth Level Headline
###### Sixth Level Headline
```

### Third Level Headline {.myclass}

A third headline is more decent and lower prioritized than a second level headline.

#### Fourth Level Headline

A fourth level headline is more decent and lower prioritized than a third level headline.

##### Fifth Level Headline

A fifth level headline is more decent and lower prioritized than a fourth level headline.

##### Sixth Level Headline

A sixth level headline is more decent and lower prioritized than a fifths level headline.

##Paragraph

For a soft linebreak (eg. for dialoges in literature), add two spaces at the end of a line and use a simple return.
She said: "Hello"  
He said: "again"

##Links

````
This is an ordinary [Link](http://typemill.net).
Links can also be [relative](/info).
You can also add a [title](http://typemill.net "typemill").
You can even add [ids or classes](http://typemill.net){#myid .myclass}.
Or you can use a shortcut like http://typemill.net.

##Images

````
The same rules as with links, but with a !
![alt-text](media/markdown.png)
![alt-text](media/markdown.png "my title"){#myid .imgClass}
![alt-text](media/markdown.png "my title"){#myid .otherclass width=150px}

## Linked Images

````
You can link an image with a nested syntax like this:
[![alt-text](media/markdown.png)](https://typemill.net)

You can link an image with a nested syntax like this:

[![alt-text](media/markdown.png){.imgClass}](https://typemill.net)

## Image Position

````
You can controll the image position with the classes .left, .right and .middle like this:
![alt-text](media/markdown.png){.left}
![alt-text](media/markdown.png){.right}
![alt-text](media/markdown.png){.middle}
````

![image float left](media/markdown.png){.left}

The first image should float on the left side of this paragraph. This might not work with all themes. If you are a theme developer, please ensure that you support the image classes "left", "right" and "middle". You can add these classes manually in the raw mode or you can assign them in the visual mode when you edit a picture (double click on it to open the dialog.)

![image float right](media/markdown.png){.right}

The second image should float on the right side of this paragraph. This might not work with all themes. If you are a theme developer, please ensure that you support the image classes "left", "right" and "middle". You can add these classes manually in the raw mode or you can assign them in the visual mode when you edit a picture (double click on it to open the dialog.)

![image middle](media/markdown.png){.middle}

The thirds image should be placed above this paragraph and centered to the middle of the content area. This might not work with all themes. If you are a theme developer, please ensure that you support the image classes "left", "right" and "middle".

## Blockquote

```
There are always some women and men with wise words
> But I usually don't read them, to be honest.
```

##Footnotes

````
You can write footnotes[^1] with markdown. 
Scroll down to the end of the page[^2] and look for the footnotes.
Add the footnote text at the bottom of the page like this:
[^1]: Thank you for scrolling.
[^2]: This is the end of the page.

Footnotes won't work with the visual editor right now, so please use the raw mode for them.

## Abbreviations

````
*[HTML]: Hyper Text Markup Language
*[W3C]: World Wide Web Consortium
````

You won't see the abbreviation directly, but if you write HTML or W3C somewhere, then you can see the tooltip with the explanation.

## Code

````
Let us create some `<?php inlineCode(); ?>` like this
````

Let us create some `<?php inlineCode(); ?>` and now let us check, if a codeblock works:

````
Use four apostroph like this:  
\`â€‹```
<?php
	$welcome = 'Hello World!';
	echo $welcome;
?>  
\````
````

Which will result in:

````
<?php
	$welcome = 'Hello World!';
	echo $welcome;
?>  
````
## Math

Please activate the math-plugin to use mathematical expressions. You can choose between MathJax or the newer KaTeX library. If you don't want to fetch code from a CDN, use KaTeX instead. The markdown syntax in TYPEMILL is the same for both libraries: 

````
Use inline $x = \int_{0^1}^1(-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac})/(2a)$ math
Use inline \(x = \int_{0^1}^1(-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac})/(2a)\) math.
````

Use inline math $x = \int_{0^1}^1(-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac})/(2a)$ like this. 

````
Use display math like this 
$$
x = \int_{0^1}^1(-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac})/(2a)
$$
or this
\[
x = \int_{0^1}^1(-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac})/(2a)
\]
````

$$
x = \int_{0^1}^1(-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac})/(2a)
$$
